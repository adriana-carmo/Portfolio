Responsive Portfolio
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

### Technology

On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

Navbar on each page contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

use semantic html.

Contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
